# Victoria 3 Artificial Flavor Mod

This is a project to add flavor to Victoria 3 using OpenAI that I created while learning how to use OpenAI. In the Mods folder are several flavor mods created using AI. You
can also make your own mods by re-running my code with different prompts.

## Mods
Country Description Flavor:
* Generates unique, new country descriptions using AI for all countries (up from 83).
* Some country descriptions are really good! They include nuanced historical details from the time that would surprise an amateur historian.
* Some country descriptions are hilariously wrong. These are generally the tags for which not much is known.
* Some country descriptions may include events that happened after 1836.

* Changes the text for inventions to pirate

Hemingway Interest Group Traits
* Changes interest group traits to hemingway

Shakespearean Diplomatic Plays
* Changes diplomatic plays text to shakespearean
